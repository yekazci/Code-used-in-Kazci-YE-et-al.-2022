This repository contains the data visualisation script used for nerve diameter analysis of heart images included in Kazci YE. et al., 2022. 

Maximum projection images produced from the whole heart z-stacks were processed in neuTube 1.0 software.

The visdata_03 and stitching_02 scripts were written by Charless C. Fowlkes and used in Rajendran PS. et al., 2019 paper. It was obtained from  "https://bitbucket.org/fowlkes/heart_mapping/src/master/"


I wrote a short script to rename the tile .swc files such that they contain the X-Y indices of the tiles in the final stictched .swc file. 

I modified the stitching_02 script for the dimensions of my tile neural trace data.

Maximum projection images produced from the whole heart z-stacks were processed in neuTube 1.0 software. Output nerve tracing files (.swc) 
were used as input in the visdata function.
